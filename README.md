# 🏈 College Football Analysis Project

This repository contains the code, analysis, and visualizations for a project exploring the relationship between **offensive yardage** and **team success** in college football. Our goal was to determine whether offensive performance metrics, particularly yards per game, are reliable indicators of win rates.

## 📊 Project Overview

College football is a complex game influenced by numerous variables—offense, defense, turnovers, and more. This project focuses on offensive performance and its correlation with team wins across a full season.

Key components of the analysis include:
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Hypothesis testing
- Machine learning regression models
- Time series or text analytics (optional extension)
- Interpretation of statistical significance and model performance

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. **Is there a statistically significant relationship between offensive yards per game and win totals?**
2. **Which regression model best predicts wins based on offensive stats?**
3. **Does margin of victory (MOV) add explanatory power to our models?**
4. **How well do machine learning models perform compared to baseline statistics?**

---

## 📈 Methods Used

- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  Summary stats and correlation analysis for key variables (e.g., mean yards/game, win %, MOV).

- **Hypothesis Testing**  
  T-tests and p-values to evaluate whether relationships are statistically significant.

- **Regression Models**
  - Linear Regression

- **Model Evaluation**
  - R² values

---

## ✅ Key Findings (FINISH THIS)

- The strongest predictor of wins was ________, with an R² value of ____.
- The p-value for offensive yards per game was ____, indicating (significance/no significance).
- Adding **margin of victory** improved model performance by ____%.
- Best model: **[Model Name]**, with an R² of ____ and RMSE of ____.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Include defensive metrics for a more holistic view.
- Explore classification models (e.g., logistic regression) to predict bowl eligibility.
- Incorporate play-by-play or player-level data for granular insights.
